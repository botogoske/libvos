<p>
DNS module is a network module to talk to DNS server in low level. "Talk" in
this context mean is when you want to know the IP address of some host name
(i.e. www.google.com) you must ask the DNS server. How the query data packed,
send to DNS server, received (a reply) the data back from DNS server, and
unpacked the data back is what this module provide.
</p>
<p>
The high level of this API is provided by libc through
"<tt>gethostbyname()</tt>" and their variants, where their output is already
simplified into string of IP address.
</p>
<p>
DNS module is separated into three module: <tt>DNS_rr</tt>,
<tt>DNSQuery</tt>, and the main module <tt>Resolver</tt>.
