# libvos Coding Style

	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
	"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Background

After writing program long enough in C, I am started to developing some
pattern in my code. Most recognizable pattern is, in example,

	func(struct adt* obj, int param)

where `struct adt` is a collection of data that is dependable whether it is
mutual or not, and `func` is a function that change the content of data in
`obj`.

In C++ this pattern can be handled easily using `class` syntax, why
make it complicated if a compiler can handle it.

Unlike C, which is have a simple and minimalistic syntax, C++ offer a more
grammar to their user, on this library I only use three of them,

* `class`, including public and private section,
* `namespace`, and
* inheritance or class hierarchies.

Rationale: First, C++ syntax is a mess. There is `<` for number comparison,
and also for opening template declaration. There is `<<` for bitwise and `<<`
for sending to stream. This, almost all time, make the code is unreadable.

Second, there is a standard that not every compiler can catch up with it.


## File naming

* The file name for source file is `.cc` and for header file is `.hh`.

* Each class must have its own `.cc` and `.hh` files.

* File name for source and header must be the same with class name. For
  example if class name is `ClassName` then source and header file would be
  `ClassName.cc` and `ClassName.hh`.

### Indentation

* Indentation must use tab, not space
* Tab width must be `8`
* Text width must be `78`

### Comment

Comment should use `//` syntax instead of `/* */`, even in multiline
comments, except for special case where comment contains many '/' characters.

### Class

* Class must inherited `Object`, so it must
	* define `__cname`
	* overwrite `chars()` method

* Class must have private method for object copy and overwrite `=` operator,
  example class with `ClassName.hh`

	```
	class ClassName : public Object {
		...
	private:
		ClassName(const ClassName&);
		void operator=(const ClassName&);
	};
	```
