v0.3.0 (2016-11-)
===================

Enhancements
------------

* Buffer:
  - add static function to compare buffer from two Objects


v0.2.0 (2016-10-04)
===================

Breaking Changes
----------------

* Buffer use Object as base class. This make the method `v()` is duplicate
  with `chars()`, hence, the `v()` is removed.

* Since we define this library as C-with-Class, all headers file now is `.hh`
  to differentiate it with C and C++.

* SockAddr, Socket, SockServer, FTP, FTPD, Resolver: change port type from
  `int` to `uint16_t`

* SockAddr: Remove _next, _last attributes, dump() and ADD() methods

  - User must use List to work with list of address now.
  - Method dump() has been replaced by chars().

* Resolver:

  - Use List to replace SockAddr as list of parent server
  - Method `dump()` has been replaced with `chars()`

* SSVReader: has been refactored to use ``Buffer::split_by_whitespace()``

  - Method `get_row()` has been removed.
  - Method `open()` and `parse()` now private, user can only `reset()` and
    `load()`

* Socket: remove `_next` and `_prev` fields

* SockServer: use List class to manage client sockets

* DNS_rr: remove `_next` field

* FTPD_user: remove `_next` field
* FTPD_client: remove `_next`, `_prev`, and `_last` fields
* FTPD_cmd: remove `_next` field
* FTPD: replace FTPD_user, FTPD_client, and FTPD_cmd with List

* RecordMD: remove `_next` and `_n_md` fields

  This change affect Reader and Writer, because we pass the meta data not
  as pointer to RecordMD anymore but as pointer List object.

* Add `DSV` prefix to Reader, Writer, Record, and RecordMD module

  Reader, Writer, Record, and RecordMD are used for reading delimited
  separated value, not to be confused with reading and writing normal file.


Enhancements
------------

* Class Object for base class in all future classes

* Implement binary node, which can be use for double linked list, queue,
  or in binary tree (BNode.hh)

* Implement circular double linked list (List.hh), thread safe.

* Buffer: add method to split buffer content by character

* Implement pthread mutex as Locker.

* Dlogger,OCI,SockServer: replace pthread mutex with Locker object

Fixes
-----

* DNSQuery: fix SOA parsing
* Remove linking to libstd++
* Compilation error on 32 bit machine and ARM
* Resolver: fix port not resetted if server list contain more than one
  addresses.
* SockServer: Increase socket listen backlog to 2048
* Buffer: VSNPRINTF, do not print empty character (0 or NULL), which caused
  the string truncated when printed to stdout.
